To push this file to GitHub via Git:
 - Because I started by cloning the repository to this system, I don't need to worry about
   adding the remote repository to my local system (because it already happened when I cloned it).
   I can verify this with the `git remote -v`, which reports the url of my GitHub repository
 - I can stage this file (and version of this file) for a commit using the `git add excercise-9.txt`
 - I can create a commit with a commit message with the `git commit -m "commit for excercise 9"` 
   command.
 - I can push this commit from my local repository to the remote (GitHub) repository with the `git
   push` command.
